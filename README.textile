*The Arms Locker - Limited Resource Management*
The Arms Locker attempts to solve a simple problem: "Who has what?"
Whether you are managing IP addresses on a static network or books
you've loaned to friends, you can use The Arms Locker to track who has
what.

*Install & Use*
Installing is simple. You just need the /web-app hosted in any webserver
supporting PHP 5.2.1. If you wish to use SQlite you can use the provided
database in /web-db/default.sdb. Otherwise the code is only limited by
the databases supported by the PHP PDO implementation.
